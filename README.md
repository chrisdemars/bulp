# Bulp!

Bulp is a basic Gulp build system that anyone can use as a boilerplate for their Web project or hybrid mobile app. It is packed with all the things you need to get you project off the ground and production ready.


Although it does not have all the bells and whistles like CSS and JavaScript linting (future feature), it does minify, concatenate, and optimize images, as well as live reload the browser using Browsersync.


Bulp is open source so feel free to add new features and submit PR's if you feel this could benefit from this nifty package.
